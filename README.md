Key Features:

        - Design Pattern: Implements the Page Object Model for cleaner code structure and reusability.
        - Data Sources: Test data sourced dynamically from:  .properties files, Excel sheets via Apache POI
        - Reporting: Interactive HTML reports using Aventstack ExtentReports
        - PDF reports generated with the iText library
        - Cross-Browser Testing: Runs tests in parallel across Chrome and Edge (easily extendable to other browsers).
